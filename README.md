# Cloud_And_Web_Services_Assessment_1

Some sections of this code come from provided Cloud & Web Services Workshop code, presumably written by Abimbola Sangodoyin.

For this assessment, you are tasked with designing and developing a REST
API that connects to a database and posts/returns meaningful data for a
fictional multinational cycle manufacturing company called Adventure
Works Cycles. APIs are used extensively for data-driven applications and are
commonly deployed as cloud services to provide scalability. APIs are
considered the backbone of cloud solutions, enabling seamless
communication between different services and systems. They provide the
connectivity and flexibility necessary for scalable, accessible, and efficient
interactions within a cloud-based environment.
In this assessment, you are to develop APIs endpoints to interact with a
database. The database contains data such as the parts and materials to
manufacture cycles as well as customer information. The database you must
use for the assessment is built on MySQL and called AdventureWorks. The
database is hosted on the school lab machines as part of the Docker Desktop
MySQL server. As part of the REST API development process, you must
design and develop a collection of API endpoints that perform CRUD
operations and authentication on the database. More detail on the endpoint
requirements is provided below. The details of the development tools you
must use are listed below and will be discussed throughout the module
lectures and workshops:

• Visual Studio Code
• AdventureWorks Database
• FASTAPI application in Python

You must not use any tools or databases other than those specified for the
development of the REST API or a mark of zero will be applied for the
assessment.
